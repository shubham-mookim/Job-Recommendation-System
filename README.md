**Job Reccomendation System**

This repository contains a content-based job recommendation system.

## Files
- **test6.py:** Python script implementing the recommendation system.
- **job_recommendation_large_dataset.csv:** Dataset used for the recommendations.

## How It Works
1. The user provides their skills and work experience as input.
2. The system calculates similarity scores using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
3. It generates job recommendations and evaluates precision, recall, F1-score, and MAP.

## Instructions
- Run `test6.py` using Python 3
- Ensure the dataset file is in the same directory as the script
